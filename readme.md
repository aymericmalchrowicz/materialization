# Materialization

This project made to show how to make Material graphical effects from scratch or to reuse as lib in your own project.

It is inspired from [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components) project and [Material Kit (Bootstrap)](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit). But I try to do it with the simplest way to do.

## Why did I do that ?

I simply did that for my own need first in simple dynamic page.



I hope this project will inspire you for yours, beginner and experimented ones...
